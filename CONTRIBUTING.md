## üßëüíª Development Setup

To get started with development, you can run the application in debug mode using Docker Compose. Several helpful Docker Compose commands are already defined in the `deployment/Makefile`.

## üèÉ Prerequisites

This project requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for both development and production environments. Please make sure both are installed on your system before proceeding.

Verify your installation with:
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

  ```
- Check your current directory:

## Pre-commit Hooks

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automate code quality checks before each commit. To set it up:

1. Install pre-commit (if not already installed):
    ```sh
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2. Install the hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
    ```sh
    pre-commit install
    ```

Now, the configured checks (such as linting and formatting) will run automatically when you commit changes.

### ‚ùÑÔ∏è Nix

If you use Nix or NixOS, you can set up the development environment with:

```sh
nix-shell
./vscode.sh
```
*Note: The Nix shell will soon install all dependencies automatically.*

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

- Generate your `.env` file from the example and update it with your email configuration:
  ```sh
  cd deployment
  cp .env.example .env
  nano .env  # Edit as needed
  ```

- Build and start the application:
  ```sh
  make build
  make devweb
  ```

- Run migrations and load initial data:
  ```sh
  make shell c=devweb
  python manage.py migrate
  python manage.py loaddata changes/fixtures/initial_data.json
  # Exit the shell with Ctrl+D
  ```

- Start the development server:
  ```sh
  make devweb-runserver
  ```

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:62202](http://localhost:62202). The default super admin credentials are `qgisadmin` / `qgisadmin`.

### More Information

For detailed instructions, please refer to the [README-dev](./README-dev.md) and [README-docker](./README-docker.md) files. These documents provide comprehensive information about both development and production environments, similar to the original [Projecta](https://github.com/kartoza/projecta.git) application.
